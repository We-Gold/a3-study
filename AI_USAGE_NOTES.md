# Agentic AI Usage Notes

- Right now, we have a few sample plot components in the config. These are loading the data directly. For the study, what we want to do is to show 20 line charts, and 20 colorfields. Half of each are permuted. The data file should be referenced for this purpose. Can you come up with a plan for how to adapt our current code for the full study setup?
